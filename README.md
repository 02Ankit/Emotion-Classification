# Emotion-Classification
Implementing Linear SVMs - 15 subject faces with happy /sad emotion are provided in the data. Each image is of 100 X 100
matrix. Perform PCA to reduce the dimension from 10000 to k. Implement a classifier on the training images with linear kernel based support 
vector machine. One potential source of SVM implementation is the LIBSVM package.

a)Use the SVM to classify the test images. How does the performance change for varous choice of kernel, parameter C and âˆˆ.
How does the performance change as a function of K.

b)Compare the SVM classifier with LDA Classifier and comment on 
the similarity and differences in term of the problem formulation as well as the performance.
